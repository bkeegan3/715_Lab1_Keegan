## Requirements
Develop a C or C++ application which executes on an Arduino and displays a user typed string. The first option to display the string is through morse code on a LED. The second option to display the string is with a LCD screen. If the morse code option is selected, all basic Latin letters(A-Z) and Arabic numerals(0-9) must have a morse code implementation.
